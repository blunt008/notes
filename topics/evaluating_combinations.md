<h1>Evaluating Combinations<h1>

In evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.

To evaluate a combination, do the following:

* Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
* Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression 
  (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other
  subexpressions (the operands). 

First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to accomplish 
the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the evaluation 
process on each element of the combination.
