<h1>Gate implementation / Gate Interface</h1>

Gate Interface is a gate abstraction. The interface answers the question WHAT 
the gate should be doing. 

If you want to understand HOW the chip is working internally, you have to look
deeper and see how the chip is constructed (Its implementation).

Gate interface is unique, there is only one way to describe what the gate is 
doing. 

At the same time there might be several different possible implementations 
(less energy, less/more expensive etc.)

One abstraction, many different implementations!
