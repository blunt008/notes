<h1>Functions versus Procedures</h1>

There is an important difference between mathematical functions and computer
procedures. Procedures must be **effective**. 

The contrast between a function and procedure is a reflection of the general 
distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do 
things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between 
*declarative knowledge* and *imperative knowledge*.
