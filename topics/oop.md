<h4>OOP Principles</h4>

* **Data encapsulation** - methedology of "hiding" internal/core data OR
    behaviour away from world.

* **Data abstraction** - idea of prividing services dividing in layers where
    each layer builts on top of the other and depends on the layer above.
    Abstraction tells us to provide simplified version of the implementation.

* **Inheritance** - mechanism for creating parent-child relationships between
    classes, Allows us reuse code between implementations. 

* **Polymorphism** - "one name, many forms". Same method can produce different
    operations.
