<h1>OOP Principles<h1>

* **Data encapsulation** - methodology of "hiding" internal/core data OR/AND
    behaviour away from world.

* **Data abstraction** - idea of prividing services divided in layers where
    each layer builts on top of the other and depends on the layer above.
    Abstraction tells us to provide simplified version of the implementation.

* **Inheritance** - mechanism for creating parent-child relationship between
    classes. Allows us to reuse code between implementations and define "IS A"
    relationship. 

* **Polymorphism** - "one name many forms". Same method can use different 
    procedure when executed in different context.
