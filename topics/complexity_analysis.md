<h1>Complexity Analysis</h1>

What makes on solution better than another? It's whether or not it has a better 
complexity. 

Complexity can be further divided into 2 different concepts:

* Time complexity 
* Space complexity 

Together they form Space-Time complexity. 

In a high-level overview:

* Time complexity is a measure how fast an algorithm or solution runs 
* Space complexity is a measure how much memory or space the algorithm uses up 

Data structure operations have time and space complexity ramifiactions. In other 
words, to perform an operation or a function on a given data structure it's going 
to take up time and memory.
