<h1>Access Networks</h1>

Having considered the applications and end systems at the "edge of the network", 
let's consider the "access network" - the network that physically connects 
an end system to the first router (also known as the "edge router") on a path
from the end system to any other end system. 

There are several types of access networks:

* Home access (DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, Satellite, Ethernet, WiFi)
* Enterprise access (Ethernet, WiFi)
* Wide-Area wireless access (3G/4G/5G, LTE)
