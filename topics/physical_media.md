<h1>Physical Media</h1>

In order to define what is meant by a physical medium, lets reflect on the brief
life of a *bit*. Consider a bit traveling from one end system, through a series 
of links and routers, to another end system. The bit gets kicked around and 
transmitted many, many times. The source end system first transmits the bit, 
and shortly thereafter the first router in the series receives the bit; the first 
router then transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the second router 
receives the bit; and so on. Our bit, when traveling from source to destination,
passes through a series of *transmitter-receiver* pairs. For each transmitter-
receiver pair, the bit is sent by *propagating electromagnetic waves* or 
*optical pulses* across **physical medium**. The physical medium can take many 
shapes and forms and does not have to be of the same type for each 
transmitter-receiver pair along the path. 

Examples of physical media include twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, 
multimode fiber-optic cable, terrestrial radio spectrum, and satellite radio 
spectrum. 

Physical media fall into two categories:

* **guided media** - waves are guided along a solid medium, such as fiber-optic
                     cable 
* **unguided media** - waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space such
                       as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel.
