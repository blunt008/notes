<h1>What is a Protocol?</h1>

Important!
It takes two (or more!) communicating entities running the same protocol in 
order to accomplish a task.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote 
entities is *governed* by a protocol. 

For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers 
control the flow of bits on the "wire" between the two network interface cards;
congestion control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets
are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine 
a packet's path from source to destination.

*A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between 
two or more communication entities, as well as the actions taken on the 
transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event*

Different protocols are used to accomplish different communication tasks.
