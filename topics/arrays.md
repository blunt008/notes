<h1>Arrays</h1>

There are 2 types of Arrays:

* Static arrays 
* Dynamic arrays 

Static arrays require to explicitly declare how big (its length) the array is, 
in order to allocate back-to-back memory slots.   

What are some common operations that we perform on arrays? 

<h2>Reading a value</h2>

Reading/accessing value at a given index is a very basic operation:

```python
    array[2]
```

This operation runs in constant time, meaning it never changes regardless of how 
big your array is.
