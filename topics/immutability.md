<h1>Mutability and immutability</h1>

*Mutability* literally means "the quality of being changeable" and in 
programming, it refers to the idea of changing the state of the object after 
it has been created. 

*Mutable* objects can be altered once they've been created and immutable cannot.
Immutable objects always represent the same value.

In the context of custom objects, we can also talk about *weak immutability*
and *strong immutability*. Weak immutability is when some fields of an object 
are immutable and others are mutable. Strong immutability is when all fields are 
immutable.
