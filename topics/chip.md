<h1>Chip</h1>

Every digital device is based on a set of chips designed to **store and process
information**. These chips may come in different shapes and forms, they are all 
made from the same building blocks: *Elementary logic gates*. These gates can be 
physically implemented in many different materials, but their logical behaviour 
is consistent across all computers.
