<h1>Logic Gates</h1>

Boolean function is a function that operates on binary inputs and returns binary
outputs. 

A *gate* is a physical device that implements a Boolean function. We can use 
term *gates* when refering to simple chips. 

Logic gate can be elementary or composite. 

Elementary (Nand, And, Or, Not) gate is designed to provide a well-defined 
functionality. 

Composite (Mux, Adder, ...) is one which is made up from elementary logic gates
and other composite gates (more complex one).
