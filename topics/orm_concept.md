<h1>Object-Relational Mapping</h1>

Programming languages and database work with data *differently*. There is an
approach called **Object-Relational Mapping** or **ORM** that is able to 
"translate" the database-way of interacting with information in an 
object-oriented way or to translate it backward. 

**Object-Relational Mapping** is a concept of converting data from an
object-oriented programming language to relational database representation 
and vice versa. It solves the problem of matching two different type systems
together and synchronize the data flow between them. 

The main parts of ORM are:
* Virtual tables 
* Relations
* Operations with objects
