<h1>Elements of Programming<h1>

<h3>Each powerful programming languages has three mechanisms for combining
simple ideas to form more complex ideas:</h3>

* **primitive expressions** - which represent the simplest entities the
    language is concerned with (simplest entities - entities provided
    by the manufacturer a.k.a. built-in).

* **means of combination** - by which compound elements are built from simpler
    ones.

* **means of abstraction** - by which compound elements can be given name and 
    manipulated as unit.


<h3>In programming we deal with two kinds of elements:</h3>

* **data** - data is "stuff", "things" that we want to manipulate.

* **procedures** - description of rules that allow us to manipulate data.

Any powerful programming language should describe primitive data and primitive 
procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures 
and data.
